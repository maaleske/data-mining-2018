    "Data tends to come in many formats (both syntax and file formats), which all have their idiosyncracies. Some common pitfalls to look out for:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Date formats (DD/MM/YY vs MM/DD/YY vs YYYY/MM/DD vs ...)\n",
    "- Comma vs. period as decimal separator\n",
    "- Non-latin characters\n",
    "- Alphabetic ordering (or lack of it)\n",
    "- Automatic parsing to the wrong type. Can and will result in hard-to-debug arithmetic errors, when e.g. dates are interpreted as values or vice versa (Excel has been infamous for this: 2018-02-16 = 2000)\n",

    "## Missing values\n",
    "\n",
    "Samples do not always contain all the variables. In the case of the previous Windermere dataset, if we were to consider each day a separate sample, not all variables would have been measured for each day.\n",

    "## Scaling\n",
    "\n",
    "Many machine learning methods expect data to be in certain ranges, or do not function well with dissimilar ranges of different variables.\n",
